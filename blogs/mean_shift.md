# Mean Shift Clustering

## Characteristics:
1. Does not require number of clusters pre-defined
2. Paremter free
3. O(n^{2})

## Hyperparemeters:
1. Choice of Kernel
2. Radius

## Algorithm:
1. Define each point as cluster
2. Re-calculate mean, shift mean of each point to corresponding cluster
3. Iterate until convergence.
