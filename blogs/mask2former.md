[Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former)

* Authors proposed a universal transformer based (meta) architecture for Universal Segmentation i.e. Semantic, Instance, and Panoptic
* It's to be noted that this does not mean a foundation model (though they argue panoptic model can be used for semantic and instance segmentation), the paper focuses on providing a universal architecture and training framework that does not require modification specific to any of the segmentation tasks.
